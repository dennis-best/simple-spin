===========

##About
The world's simplest loading (or anything) spinner.

##Usage
Include the CSS in your project

Create a div named ".simple-spin" in your markup and stick an image or svg in it or leave the div empty and add background-image and background-size to the ".simple-spin" class.

I've included an SVG spinner
